# US 3004 - As User, I want to share a board

## 1. Context

*Implement a functionality that allows any user to share his shared boards.*

## 2. Requirements

**US 3004 -** As User, I want to share a board

## 3. Analysis

*For the user to be able to share a shared board, initially he has to choose the one he wants to share. Next, he will see 
the list of system users, which no longer includes himself, and select a user. It assigns a type of permission, write or 
read only, and a shared board invitation is created, so the user selected already has access to the board. The previous action loops 
until the owner decides he doesn't want to invite anyone else. While selecting users, they no longer appear in the list of available users.*

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

This US has been implemented in the shared board server and in the app. These two applications communicate with each other, that is, the app requests
information from the server and the latter, being the one with access to the database, returns the request. These requests are made through messages that include a code that characterizes each action.
- As indicated above, the owner needs access to the shared boards he created and which are open. Therefore, the app sends a message to the server with
  the code SHAREDBOARD_CREATE and the server, accessing the database, sends another message, this one with the code SEND_MESSAGE, which will return the desired list.
- A similar action happens with listing the users, but here the code that the app sends to the server becomes LIST_USERS.
- The last message sent by the app is to ask the server to create/save the shared board invitation in the database, using the SHARE_SHAREDBOARD code, if everything goes well, the app will receive an ACK, otherwise it will receive an ERR.

- First the user makes a request to receive all the boards he created
- Next, you need access to all users to be able to share your board. The owner is removed from this list, and as you select the 
person you want to share with, you assign a permission and the selected person is removed from the list of available users. 
- For each user selected, a shared board invitation is created.

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

* Controller

### 4.4. Tests

**Test Get Code From String:** *The tests below are included in the Request Message Test class 
of tests and verifies that it transforms the string code well into what is associated with it.*
```
testCode = MessageCode.SHAREDBOARD_CREATE;
        result = 7;
        System.out.println("C贸digo para " + testCode + ": " + result);
        byte expected7 = getCodeFromString(MessageCode.SHAREDBOARD_CREATE);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, expected7);
        
testCode = MessageCode.LIST_USERS;
        result = 10;
        System.out.println("C贸digo para " + testCode + ": " + result);
        byte expected10 = getCodeFromString(MessageCode.LIST_USERS);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, expected10);
        
testCode = MessageCode.SHARE_SHAREDBOARD;
        result = 9;
        System.out.println("C贸digo para " + testCode + ": " + result);
        byte expected9 = getCodeFromString(MessageCode.SHARE_SHAREDBOARD);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, expected9);
        
testCode = MessageCode.SEND_MESSAGE;
        result = 6;
        System.out.println("C贸digo para " + testCode + ": " + result);
        byte expected6 = getCodeFromString(MessageCode.SEND_MESSAGE);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, expected6);

**Controller:** In this class, this is where the "communication" between the shred board server and the shared board app takes place. 
In order for us to share the shared board, we have to ask the server for some information. For each piece of information we ask for, 
there is an associated code that goes into the handling, as well as the data needed to obtain the expected results. As the server is the only one that has access to the database, the app "asks" and the server returns it.
- Initially, we need to obtain a list of the shared boards that we have created, in order to be able to select the one we want to share (action associated with the SHAREDBOARD_CREATE code);
- The user selects the desired one and now needs to view all the system users to choose from (action associated with the LIST_USERS code). The list you see no longer includes yourself! 
This action is in a loop until the owner decides he doesn't want to share with anyone else. As he selects people, the list he sees later no longer includes already selected users.
- When selecting the user to share, the owner is asked what permission this user should have, write or read only. Depending on the selection, a shared board invitation is created, which includes the shared board,
the user and the permission assigned to it (action associated with the SHARE_SHAREDBOARD code).

## 6. Integration/Demonstration
**Owner choose a shared board to share** </br>
![choose board](Support_3004/choose_Board.png)

**Owner choose a user and gives him a write permission**
- Note that the owner, isep222, is not on this list </br>
![teacher1](Support_3004/teacher1.png)

**Owner choose another user and gives him a read only permission** 
- Note that the user chosen before is no longer on the list (teacher1) </br>
![isep333](Support_3004/isep333.png)

**In here we can see the shared board invitation created, with the right permission** </br>
![Data base](Support_3004/DB.png)

**Teacher1 can create post-it in the shared board that was shared with him, because he has a write permission** </br>

**isep333 can't create post-it in the shared board that was shared with him, because he has a read only permission, he does not have access to that board** </br>

## 7. Observations

*Access to the repository is always done in the same way.
For this reason, an example sequence diagram has been created to demonstrate this. To exemplify, we list all existing questions in the repository of questions.*

![Access to the repositorys](Support_3004/repository.svg)

*Like the repositories, the authentication part always follows the same order of ideas.
In this way, we perform a general SD that demonstrates the entire process. In the diagram, US 1008 is taken as an example,
as a Student, I want to request my enrollment in a course.*
